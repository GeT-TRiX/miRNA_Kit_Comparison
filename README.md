# miRNA_Kit_Comparison
This project evaluates 4 different commercially available small RNA sequencing kits.

There are two main analyses:

1.	Reproducibility

    1.	Within a single study
    2.	Across studies
    
This was evaluated by looking at the correlation of counts for the same sample multiple times within the same study or in different studies.

2.	Accuracy

This was evaluated using equimolar synthetic oligonucleotides that are the same sequences as canonical human, rat, mouse, and virus miRNAs. We assessed how similar the results were across the different oligonucleotides.
